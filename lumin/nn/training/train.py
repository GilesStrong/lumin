    r'''
    Main training method for :class:`~lumin.nn.models.model.Model`.
    Trains a specified numer of models created by a :class:`~lumin.nn.models.model_builder.ModelBuilder` on data provided by a
    :class:`~lumin.nn.data.fold_yielder.FoldYielder`, and saves them to `savepath`.

    Note, this does not return trained models, instead they are saved and must be loaded later. Instead this method returns results of model training.
    Each :class:`~lumin.nn.models.model.Model` is trained on N-1 folds, for a :class:`~lumin.nn.data.fold_yielder.FoldYielder` with N folds, and the remaining
    fold is used as validation data.
        
    Depending on the live_fdbk arguments, live plots of losses and other metrics may be shown during training, if running in Jupyter.
    Showing the live plot slightly slows down the training, but can help highlight problems without having to wait to the end.
    If not running in Jupyter, then losses are printed to the terminal.

    Once training is finished, the state with the lowest validation loss is loaded, evaluated, and saved.

    Arguments:
        fy: :class:`~lumin.nn.data.fold_yielder.FoldYielder` interfacing ot training data
        n_models: number of models to train
        bs: batch size. Number of data points per iteration
        model_builder: :class:`~lumin.nn.models.model_builder.ModelBuilder` creating the networks to train
        n_epochs: maximum number of epochs for which to train
        patience: if not `None`, sets the number of epochs or cycles to train without decrease in validation loss before ending training (early stopping)
        loss_is_meaned: if the batch loss value has been averaged over the number of elements in the batch, this should be true
        cb_partials: optional list of functools.partial, each of which will instantiate a :class:`~lumin.nn.callbacks.callback.Callback` when called
        metric_partials: optional list of functools.partial, each of which will a instantiate :class:`~lumin.nn.metric.eval_metric.EvalMetric`,
            used to compute additional metrics on validation data after each epoch.
            :class:`~lumin.nn.callbacks.monitors.SaveBest` and :class:`~lumin.nn.callbacks.monitors.EarlyStopping` will also act on the (first) metric set to 
            `main_metric` instead of loss, except when another callback produces an alternative loss and model
            (like :class:`~lumin.nn.callbacks.model_callbacks.SWA`).
        pred_cb: pred_cb: :class:`~lumin.nn.callbacks.pred_handlers.PredHandler` callback to determin how predictions are computed.
            Default simply returns the model predictions. Other uses could be e.g. running argmax on a multiclass classifier
        train_on_weights: If weights are present in training data, whether to pass them to the loss function during training
        bulk_move: if true, will optimise for speed by using more RAM and VRAM
        start_mode_id: model ID at whcih to start training,
            i.e. if training was interupted, this can be set to resume training form the last model which was trained
        live_fdbk: whether or not to show any live feedback at all during training (slightly slows down training, but helps spot problems)
        live_fdbk_first_only: whether to only show live feedback for the first model trained (trade off between time and problem spotting)
        live_fdbk_extra: whether to show extra information live feedback (further slows training)
        live_fdbk_extra_first_only: whether to only show extra live feedback information for the first model trained (trade off between time and information)
        savepath: path to to which to save model weights and results
        plot_settings: :class:`~lumin.plotting.plot_settings.PlotSettings` class to control figure appearance

    Returns:
        - results list of validation losses and other eval_metrics results, ordered by model training. Can be used to create an :class:`~lumin.nn.ensemble.ensemble.Ensemble`.
        - histories list of loss histories, ordered by model training
        - cycle_losses if an :class:`~lumin.nn.callbacks.cyclic_callbacks.AbsCyclicCallback` was passed, lists validation losses at the end of each cycle, ordered by model training. Can be passed to :class:`~lumin.nn.ensemble.ensemble.Ensemble`.
