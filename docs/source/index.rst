LUMIN
===================================================

Lumin Unifies Many Improvements for Networks

LUMIN aims to become a deep-learning and data-analysis ecosystem for
High-Energy Physics, and perhaps other scientific domains in the future.
Similar to `Keras`_ and `fastai`_ it is a wrapper framework for a graph
computation library (PyTorch), but includes many useful functions to
handle domain-specific requirements and problems. It also intends to
provide easy access to to state-of-the-art methods, but still be
flexible enough for users to inherit from base classes and override
methods to meet their own demands.
