# Targeting v0.7.1

## Important changes

- `EvalMetrics` revised to inherit from `Callback` and be called on validation data after every epoch. User-written `EvalMetrics` willneed to be adjusted to work with the new calling method: adjust `evaluate` method and constructor may need to be adjusted; see existing metrics to see how.
  
## Breaking

- `eval_metrics` argument in `train_models` renamed to `metric_partials` and now takes a list of partial `EvalMetrics`
- User-written `EvalMetrics` will need to be adjusted to work with the new calling method: adjust `evaluate` method and constructor may need to be adjusted; see existing metrics to see how.

## Additions

- `OneCycle` now has a `cycle_ends_training` which allows training to continue at the final LR and Momentum. keeping at default of `True` ends the training once the cycle is complete, as usual.
- `to_np` now returns `None` when input tensor is `None`
- `plot_train_history` now plots metric evolution for validation data

## Removals

## Fixes

- `Model` now creates `cb_savepath` is it didn't already exist
- Bug in `PredHandler` where predictions were kept on device leading to increased memory usage
- Version issue in matplotlib affecting plot positioning

## Changes

## Depreciations

- V0.8:
    - All `EvalMetrics` depreciated with metric system. They have been copied and renamed to Old* for compatibility with the old model training system.
    - `OldEvalMetric`: Replaced by `EvalMetric`
    - `OldMultiAMS`: Replaced by `MultiAMS`
    - `OldAMS`: Replaced by `AMS`
    - `OldRegPull`: Replaced by `RegPull`
    - `OldRegAsProxyPull`: Replaced by `RegAsProxyPull`
    - `OldRocAucScore`: Replaced by `RocAucScore`
    - `OldBinaryAccuracy`: Replaced by `BinaryAccuracy`

## Comments

# v0.7.0 - All you batch are belong to us

## Important changes

- Model training and callbacks have significantly changed:
    - `Model.fit` now expects to perform the entire training proceedure, rather than just single epochs.
    - A lot of the functionality of the old training method `fold_train_ensemble` is now delegated to `Model.fit`.
    - A new ensemble training method `train_models` has replaced `fold_train_ensemble`. It provied a similar API, but aims to be more understandable to users. 
    - `Model.fit` is now 'stateful': a `fit_params` class is created containing all the information and data relevant to training the model and trainig methods change their actions according to `fit_params.state` ('train', 'valid', and 'test')
    - Callbacks now have greater potential: They have more action points during the training cycle, where they can affect training behaviour, and they have access to `fit_params`, allowing them to modify more aspects of the training and have indirect access to all other callbacks.
    - The "tick" for the training loop is now one epoch, i.e. validation loss is computed after the entire use of the training data (as opposed to after every sub-epoch), cyclic callbacks now work on the scale of epochs, rather than sub-epochs. Due to the data being split into folds, the concept of a sup-epoch still exists, but the APIs are now simplified for the user (previously they were a mixture of sup-epoch and epoch arguments).
    - For users who do not wish to transition to the new model behaviour, the existing behaviour can still be achieved by using the `Old*` models and classes. See the depreciations section for the full list. 
- Input masks (present if e.g using feature subsampling in `Model`Builder`)
    - `BatchYielder` now takes an `input_mask` argument to filter inputs
    - `Model` prediction methods no longer take input mask arguments, instead the input mask (if present) is automatically used. If users have already filtered their data, they should manually remove the input mask from the model (i.e. set it to None)
- Callbacks which take arguments related to (sub-)epochs (e.g. cycle length, scale, time to renewal. etc. for `CycleLR`, `OneCycle`, etc. and `SWA`) now take these arguments in terms of epochs. I.e. a OneCycle schedule with 9 training folds, running for 15 epochs would previously require e.g. `lenghts=(45,90)` in order to complete the cycle in 15 epochs (135 subepochs). Now it is specified as simply `lenghts=(5,10)`. Additionally, these arguments must be integers. Floats will be coerced to integers with warning.
- `lr_find` now runds over all training folds, instead of just 1
  
## Breaking

- Heavy renaming of methods and classes due to changes in model trainng and callbacks.

## Additions

- `__del__` method to `FowardHook` class
- `BatchYielder`:
    - Now takes an `input_mask` argument to filter inputs
    - Now takes an argument allowing incomplete batches to be yielded
    - Target array can now be None
- `Model`:
    - now takes a `bs` argument for `evaluate`
    - predictions can now be modified by passing a `PredHandler` callback to `pred_cb`. The default one simply returns the model predicitons, however other actions could be defined by the user, e.g. performing argmax for multiclass classifiers.

## Removals

- `Model`:
    - Now no longer takes `callbacks` and `mask_inputs` as arguments for `evaluate`
    - `evaluate_from_by` removed, just call `evaluate`
- Callbacks no longer take model and plot_settings arguments during initialisation. These should be added by calling the relevant setters. `Model` will call them when relevant.

## Fixes

- Potential bug in convolutional models where checking the out size of the head would affect the batchnorm averaging
- Potential bug in `plot_sample_pred` to do with bin ranges
- `ForwardHook` not working with passed hook functions

## Changes

- `BinaryLabelSmooth` now only applies smoothing during training and not in validation
- `Ensemble`
    - `from_results` and `build_ensemble` now no longer take `location` as an argument. Instead, results should contain the savepath for the models
    - `_build_ensemble` is now private
- `Model`:
    - `predict_array` and `predict_folds` are now private
    - `fit` now expects to perform the entire fitting of the model, rather than just one sup-epoch. Additionally, validation loss is now computed only at the end of the epoch, rather that previously where it was computed after each fold.
- `SWA` `renewal_period` should now be None in order to prevent a second average being tracked (previously was negative)
- Some examples have been renamed, and copies using the old model fitting proceedure and old callbacks are available in `examples/old`
- `lr_find` now runds over all training folds, instead of just 1

## Depreciations

    - `AbsModelCallback`: Will not be replaced
    - `OldSWA`: Replaced by `SWA`
    - `old_plot_train_history`: Replaced by `plot_train_history`
    - `OldEnsemble`: Replaced by `Ensemble`

## Comments

# v0.6.0 - Train and Converge Until it is Done

## Important changes

- `auto_filter_on_linear_correlation` now examines **all** features within correlated clusters, rather than just the most correlated pair. This means that the function now only needs to be run once, rather than the previously recommended multiple rerunning.
- Moved to Scikit-learn 0.22.2, and moved, where possible, to keyword argument calls for sklearn methods in preparation for 0.25 enforcement of keyword arguments
- Fixed error in patience when using cyclical LR callbacks, now specify the number of cycles to go without improvement. Previously had to specify 1+number.
- Matrix data is no longer passed through `np.nan_to_num` in `FoldYielder`. Users should ensure that all values in matrix data are not NaN or Inf
- Tensor data:
  - `df2foldfile`, `fold2foldfile`, and 'add_meta_data` can now support the saving of arbitrary matrices as a matrix input
  - Pass a `numpy.array` whose first dimension matches the length of the DataFrame to the `tensor_data` argument of `df2foldfile` and a name to `tensor_name`.
    The array will be split along the first dimension and the sub-arrays will be saved as matrix inputs in the resulting foldfile
  - The matrices may also be passed as sparse format and be densified on loading by FoldYielder

## Breaking

- `plot_rank_order_dendrogram` now returns sets of all features in cluster with distance over the threshold, rather than just the closest features in each cluster

## Additions

- Addition of batch size parameter to `Ensemble.predict*`
- Lorentz Boost Network (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09722):
    - `LorentzBoostNet` basic implementation which learns boosted particles from existing particles and extracts features from them using fixed kernel functions
    - `AutoExtractLorentzBoostNet` which also learns the kernel-functions during training
- Classification `Eval` classes:
    - `BinaryAccuracy`: Computes and returns the accuracy of a single-output model for binary classification tasks.
    - `RocAucScore`: Computes and returns the area under the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of a classifier model.
- `plot_binary_sample_feat`: a version of `plot_sample_pred` designed for plotting feature histograms with stacked contributions by sample for
    background.

  - Pass a `numpy.array` whose first dimension matches the length of the DataFrame to the `tensor_data` argument of `df2foldfile` and a name to `tensor_name`.
    The array will be split along the first dimension and the sub-arrays will be saved as matrix inputs in the resulting foldfile
  - The matrices may also be passed as sparse format and be densified on loading by FoldYielder
- `plot_lr_finders` now has a `log_y` argument for logarithmic y-axis. Default `auto` set log_y if maximum fractional difference between losses is greater than 50
- Added new rescaling options to `ClassRegMulti` using linear outputs and scaling by mean and std of targets
- `LsuvInit` now applies scaling to `nn.Conv3d` layers
- `plot_lr_finders` and `fold_lr_find` now have options to save the resulting LR finder plot (currently limited to png due to problems with pdf)
- Addition of AdamW and an optimiser, thanks to [@kiryteo](https://github.com/kiryteo)
- Contribution guide, thanks to [@kiryteo](https://github.com/kiryteo)
- OneCycle `lr_range` now supports a non-zero final LR; just supply a three-tuple to the `lr_range` argument.

## Removals

- `FeatureSubsample`

- Fixed early-stopping statement in `fold_train_ensemble` to state the number as "sub-epochs" (previously said "epochs")
- Fixed error in patience when using cyclical LR callbacks, now specify the number of cycles to go without improvement. Previously had to specify 1+number.

## Depreciations

## Comments

- RFPImp still imports from `sklearn.ensemble.forest` which is depreciated, and possibly part of the private API. Hopefully the package will remedy this in time for depreciation. For now, future warnings are displayed.

## Comments

# V0.2 Bonfire Lit

## Important changes

- Residual mode in `FullyConnected`:
    - Identity paths now skip two layers instead of one to align better with [arXiv:1603.05027](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027)
    - In cases where an odd number of layers are specified for the body, the number of layers is increased by one
    - Batch normalisation now corrected to be after the addition step (previously was set before)
- Dense mode in `FullyConnected` now no longer adds an extra layer to scale down to the original width, instead `get_out_size` now returns the width of the final concatinated layer and the tail of the network is expected to accept this input size
- Fixed rule-of-thumb for embedding sizes from max(50, 1+(sz//2)) to max(50, (1+sz)//2)

## Breaking

- Changed callbacks to receive `kargs`, rather than logs to allow for great flexibility
- Residual mode in `FullyConnected`:
    - Identity paths now skip two layers instead of one to align better with [arXiv:1603.05027](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027)

- Initialisation arguments for `CatEmbHead` changed considerably w.r.t. embedding arguments; now expects to receive a `CatEmbedder` class

## Additions

- Fixed crash in `plot_feat` when plotting non-bulk without cuts, and non-crash bug when plotting non-bulk with cuts
- Fixed typing of callback_args in `fold_train_ensemble`
- Fixed crash when trying to load model trained on cuda device for application on CPU device
- Fixed positioning of batch normalisation in residual mode of `FullyConnected` to after addition
- `rf_rank_features` was accidentally evaluating feature importance on validation data rather than training data, resulting in lower importances that it should
- Fixed feature selection in examples using a test size of 0.8 rather than 0.2
- Fixed crash when no importnat features were found by `rf_rank_features`
- Fixed rule-of-thumb for embedding sizes from max(50, 1+(sz//2)) to max(50, (1+sz)//2)
- Fixed cutting when saving plots as pdf

## Changes

- Moved `on_train_end` call in `fold_train_ensemble` to after loading best set of weights
- Replaced all mutable default arguments

## Depreciations

- Callbacks:
    - Added `callback_partials` parameter (a list of partials that yield a Callback object) in `fold_train_ensemble` to eventually replace `callback_args`; Neater appearance than previous Dict of object and kargs
    - `callback_args` now depreciated, to be removed in v0.4
    - Currently `callback_args` are converted to `callback_partials`, code will also be removed in v0.4
- Embeddings:
    - Added `cat_embedder` parameter to `ModelBuilder` to eventuall replace `cat_args`
    - `cat_args` now depreciated to be removed in v0.4
    - Currently `cat_args` are converted to an `Embedder`, code will also be removed in v0.4

## Comments

# V0.1.1 PyPI am assuming direct control - micro update

## Breaking

- `binary_class_cut` now returns tuple of `(cut, mean_AMS, maximum_AMS)` as opposed to just the cut
- Initialisation lookups now expected to return callable, rather than callable and dictionary of arguments. `partial` used instead.
- `top_perc` in `binary_class_cut` now treated as percentage rather than fraction

## Additions

- Added PReLU activation
- Added uniform initialisation lookup

## Removals

## Fixes

- `uncert_round` converts `NaN` uncertainty to `0`
- Correct name of internal embedding dropout layer in `CatEmbHead`: emd_do -> emb_do
- Adding missing settings for activations and initialisations to body and tail
- Corrected plot annotation for percentage in `binary_class_cut`
- loss history plot not being saved correctly

## Changes

- Removed the `BatchNorm1d` automatically added in `CatEmbHead` when using categorical inputs; assuming unit-Gaussian continuous inputs, no *a priori* resaon to add it, and tests indicated it hurt performance and train-time.
- Changed weighting factor when not loading loading cycles only to n+2 from n+1
